## Project Objectives

To build a machine learning model that manages employee’s access to various resources in an organization. The model will improve access control decisions by accurately identifying authorized or unauthorized access and adapting access privileges based on historical patterns. We will be using the Kaggle’s employee dataset to train and test the developed model. The goal is to replace the security policies with a trained machine learning model.
